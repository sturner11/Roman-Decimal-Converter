Notes for Number to Numeral: I went through several ideas, but nothing was working out fantastically, so I looked up how to turn a roman numeral into a decimal number (not code, but just in general) this website contains an explanation of how I do it. (If the goal was for us to come up with our own algorith please let me know and I will use the remaining time to come up with something different).

Time: 2:56:18

The program should be run from the command line and takes the following sets of arguments possiblities:

2 Arguments:

	1) The roman numeral or decimal
	
	2) R/r(From Roman to Decimal Conversion) or D/d(From Decimal to Roman Conversion)
	
3 Arguments:

	1) Input file (line delimited, one line for each roman numeral or decimal)
	
	2) Output file
	
	3) R/r(From Roman to Decimal Conversion) or D/d(From Decimal to Roman Conversion)
	

Thank you for considerations and time. I look forward to hearing back from you!
